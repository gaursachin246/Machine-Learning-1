    "#A) Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "#Artificial Intelligence is a broad field in computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example: A virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa is a form of AI. It can understand spoken commands, perform tasks like setting reminders or playing music, and even have conversations with users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#B) Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "#Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms on data so they can learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every specific task. The key idea is that the system improves its performance as it processes more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example: An email spam filter is an application of machine learning. It learns to identify which emails are likely to be spam based on patterns in the data (e.g., certain keywords, sender addresses) and then automatically sorts new emails into spam or inbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "#C) Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "#Deep Learning is a specialized area within machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") to analyze complex patterns in large amounts of data. Deep learning models are particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition."
